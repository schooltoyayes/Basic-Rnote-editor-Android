# Basic Rnote Editor for Android

An Android note-taking app, built in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, that reads and
writes `.rnote` files produced by [the open-source desktop application Rnote](https://github.com/flxzt/rnote).

This app does not currently embed Rnote's Rust engine — it reimplements the parts
that matter for interoperability (the v0.14 document schema, stroke geometry,
paper patterns, page layout) in pure Kotlin, so that a file drawn on the desktop
opens on a tablet and a file drawn on the tablet opens back on the desktop.

*Currently* is the operative word: the goal is to eventually run Rnote's real
Rust engine underneath this app instead of a Kotlin reimplementation of it. See
[Where this is heading](#where-this-is-heading).

## Status

Usable for handwriting and sketching, and for working on the same notes on a
desktop and a tablet. It's a personal project, not a finished product — a few UI
slots are disabled, grayed-out placeholders for parity with desktop Rnote's layout.

**Working**

- **Brush** with stylus pressure sensitivity, in Solid and Marker (translucent)
  styles. Three size presets per tool plus a numeric adjuster, and four favorite
  slots that keep a style, color and width together.
- **Shaper**: line, arrow, rectangle, ellipse, and — built from lines, as Rnote
  builds them — 2D, 3D and single-quadrant coordinate systems and a grid. Lines
  and arrows can snap to 15° steps.
- **Typewriter**: tap to add a text box or edit one; bold, italic and other
  ranges set on the desktop are kept through edits.
- **Eraser**: Trash Strokes and Split Strokes modes. Like Rnote's, it erases ink
  and shapes and leaves text and images alone.
- **Selector** (lasso), for ink and for desktop text, shapes and images alike:
  select all / deselect / duplicate / delete, drag-to-move, scale and rotate
  handles with an aspect-ratio lock, and copy / cut / paste between notes.
- **Tools**: Rnote's Vertical Space — drag down to open up room, up to close it.
- **Stylus-aware input**: stylus-only mode by default (finger pans and zooms),
  optional finger drawing, S-Pen barrel button as a momentary eraser, S-Pen Air
  Actions mapped to undo/redo, two-finger pinch-zoom and pan.
- **Paper**: six patterns (dots, grid, lines, isometric grid, isometric dots,
  blank), A2–A6 / Letter / Legal / custom / infinite page sizes, four layout
  modes (fixed page, continuous vertical, semi-infinite, infinite), custom
  background and pattern colors, adjustable spacing and DPI,
  portrait/landscape, dark mode.
- **Files**: open and save native `.rnote` (gzipped engine-snapshot JSON) and a
  simpler app-native `.json`, including "Open with" from file managers and cloud
  drives. Desktop text, shapes, images and PDF pages are shown and editable, and
  keep the JSON they were read with, so attributes the app doesn't model survive
  a round trip. Autosave, crash recovery, a warning before overwriting a file
  that changed elsewhere (save a copy, overwrite, or load the other version), a
  list of recent notes, and a page overview with thumbnails.
- **Import**: PDF pages, and pictures from the gallery or the camera, written
  the way desktop Rnote writes its own imports.
- **Export and share**: PDF, SVG, PNG, and JPEG, with page-range and split
  options and one page per imported PDF page. A Share button sends the current
  page, the selection or the whole note to another app.

**UI slots with no implementation behind them** — visible but disabled: the
Textured brush style; the three non-polygon selector modes; separate fill color.

**Not built**: layers (the stroke list is flat), the Tools pen's other styles
(Offset Camera, Zoom, Laser), document tabs.

## Where this is heading

The long-term plan is to implement Rnote's native Rust engine in the app's backend.

We believe this to be possible because Rnote's engine is already split into `rnote-compose`
(geometry and math) and `rnote-engine` (documents, strokes, rendering), and
neither crate depends on GTK — only the `rnote-ui` layer does. GTK4 is the
reason the desktop app can't run on Android; the engine underneath it has no
such problem, and should cross-compile for Android via `cargo-ndk`. See
[rnote#390](https://github.com/flxzt/rnote/issues/390) for thorough discussion
of Android support.

Note that there is no promise about timing here. This is a spare-time project and
the Kotlin backend is good enough for many use cases. If cross-compiling the engine is the sort of thing you enjoy,
this is the most ambitious thing on the roadmap — see
[Contributing](#contributing).

## Building

Requires JDK 17 and the Android SDK (compileSdk 35). The app targets Android 8.0
(API 26) and up.

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew installDebug   # to a connected device
```

`JAVA_HOME` must point at a JDK 17 or newer; Gradle will not find one on its own
if Java isn't on your `PATH`. Android Studio ships a suitable JDK:

```powershell
# Windows
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr"
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux, if you have Android Studio installed
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/Android\ Studio/jbr
```

## Contributing

Contributions are highly encouraged — issues, pull requests, or just a note that
something is broken. This is a personal project built in spare time, so replies
may not be quick, but nothing here is closed off and no contribution is too
small.

Especially useful:

- **Format compatibility bugs.** If a file drawn in desktop Rnote opens wrong
  here — or a file saved here opens wrong there — that's the most valuable kind
  of report. Please attach the `.rnote` file; the format work is essentially
  reverse-engineered, so a real file that breaks it is worth more than a
  description of the breakage.
- **Testing on other hardware.** Development happens on a single Samsung tablet
  with an S-Pen. Stylus behaviour varies a lot between vendors, and pressure,
  hover, and barrel-button handling are all places where "works here" proves
  very little. Reports from other devices are useful even when everything works.
- **The disabled tools.** The Textured brush style, the non-polygon selector
  modes and a separate fill color have UI slots wired up and waiting for an
  implementation. Layers are a bigger lift — the document model is flat today.
- **Cross-compiling Rnote's engine for Android.** The most ambitious item on the
  list, described under [Where this is heading](#where-this-is-heading). If you
  know your way around `cargo-ndk` and JNI, I'd love the help — or just the
  advice on whether the approach holds up.

A few practical notes: `./gradlew test` should pass before you open a PR —
the tests are JVM-only, no device or emulator needed. If you're changing how
`.rnote` files are read or written, please add a test backed by a real file
from desktop Rnote (the `tests/` directory holds the ones the existing tests
read) — that layer is where mistakes are quietest. And by contributing you
agree your work is licensed GPL-3.0, like the rest of the project.

If you're unsure whether an idea fits, open an issue and ask first. That's
always welcome.
