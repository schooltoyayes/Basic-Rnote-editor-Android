 * Desktop Rnote's `PressureCurve` (crates/rnote-compose/src/style/mod.rs), serde names

 *
 * This is the piece that decides how wide a stroke is actually painted. Rnote never
 * draws a stroke at its nominal `stroke_width`: it applies the curve to that width and
 * the point's pressure at *every* point along the path, so `stroke_width` is a maximum,
 * not a measurement. A renderer that ignores the curve draws every pressure-varying
 * stroke too thick — a desktop mouse stroke, which records Rnote's fallback pressure of
 * 0.5 throughout, comes out at exactly double.
